# Write a function uncompress(str) that takes in a "compressed" string as an arg. A compressed string consists of a character immediately followed by the number of times it appears in the "uncompressed" form. The function should return the uncompressed version of the string. See the examples.

Hint: you can use the built-in Number function should convert a numeric string into the number type. For example. Number("4") // => 4

You may assume that the number of times will always be an integer between 0 and 9.
